# OSGi ALLIANCE INVITES DEVELOPERS TO COMPETE IN IoT PLAYGROUND AT OSGi COMMUNITY EVENT 2015

## SDK available to developers October 1

SAN RAMON, Calif. – Aug. 27, 2015 – OSGi app developers are invited to participate in an IoT playground competition at the OSGi Community Event 2015, Nov. 3-5. The contest will demonstrate how OSGi was made for the Internet of Things as participants control a model LEGO® train track that runs multiple trains simultaneously at the event.
The train and track playground will illustrate the OSGi advantage of being able to reliably share code from the cloud all the way down to the smallest devices in an IoT environment.

The OSGi Community Event 2015 is co-located with EclipseCon Europe 2015, in Ludwigsburg, Germany. Registered attendees have access to both conference programs, including the OSGi IoT demo.

The IoT playground will use OSGi technology from the cloud to the lowest levels of sensors and actuators in the train and track playground. Developers will be able to assign tasks to the trains and see how the trains navigate the tracks.

An application manages the overall track from the cloud and provides a user interface to set assignments and show the system’s state. It communicates with edge devices that control the LEGO® trains: the switches, signals, RFID readers, and other elements. The cloud also manages all the software deployments in the system.

The demonstration is underpinned by OSGi enRoute, available in September, which provides an easy-to-use tool chain for OSGi that provides the best-known practices with a true service-oriented architecture.
The OSGi Alliance will provide a software development kit for the playground that includes a train emulator of the track and train. Participants can provide software that controls a train or the overall track. The winners of the competition will be selected and announced on the final day of the conference.

The SDK will be available Oct. 1 at [https://github.com/osgi/osgi.iot.contest.sdk[(https://github.com/osgi/osgi.iot.contest.sdk). Follow [@OSGiAlliance][twitter] on Twitter for updates and reminders.

￼Register to attend the OSGi Community Event and EclipseCon Europe. Early bird rates are available through Sept. 30.
